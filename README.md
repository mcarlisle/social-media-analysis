# social-media-analysis
a brief look and visualizations into our social media footprint:

 1. See information from the financial transactions that Google scraped from your gmail.
 2. Examine your profile / reaction counts in your Facebook profile.
 3. See a month-by-month accounting of your Instagram likes per profile.
 4. See a month-by-month line chart, and year-by-year boxplots, of a (VADER) sentiment analysis of your Facebook posts.

More to come as we poke and prod around in the data.
